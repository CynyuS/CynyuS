# Hihi! :wave:

I'm Cynthia, a sophomore 🥈 studying Computer Science 👩‍💻 and Electrical and Computer Engineering 💡 @ Cornell University </span>

## Projects!

Project Hades ✈️ *WIP*: Integrating bezier spline curves into ArduPlane <br>

OCaml GCS 🌎: A ground control system and plane simulation application <br>
- The OCaml GCS Flight Simulator (OCamlGCS) is an application that can plot waypoints and simulate flight paths for your local Cornell needs! Based on the needs of Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems, the OCamlGCS has three built in maps: Cornell, Ovid Airport, and Mojave Desert for you to simulate all your flight needs. You can plot, change, and delete waypoints,  and adjust the speed of the animation to the intended speed of your aircraft! <br>

CITR 🤖 *WIP*: An open-sourced generative AI hardware assistant to aid in Verilog code generation and EDA and synthesis <br>
- Chat is this Real? (CITR) is a curated open-sourced dataset of Verilog code and LLM generated detailed contexts for open-sourced model fine-tuning - earning 9th place at the LLM4HWDesign competition. <br>
